# Interaction Design

## Core Interaction Philosophy

**Living Cards**: Each artwork is presented as a "living card" that responds to user interaction with subtle, meaningful animations. These cards serve as portals to deeper experiences while maintaining the gallery's sophisticated aesthetic.

**Immersive Portals**: Clicking any artwork opens an immersive full-screen experience that presents the work in high resolution alongside provenance data, creator notes, and blockchain verification.

## Primary Interactions

### Living Card Behavior
- **Hover State**: 
  - 3D tilt effect (5-degree rotation on X/Y axis)
  - Subtle scale increase (1.05x)
  - Soft glow border with accent color
  - Metadata overlay fade-in (artist name, price, edition)
  - 300ms ease-out transition

- **Active State**:
  - Deeper tilt effect (8-degree rotation)
  - Scale to 1.1x
  - Intensified glow with color shift
  - Preview of artwork details
  - 150ms quick transition

### Immersive Portal Experience
- **Entry Animation**:
  - Background fades to black (500ms)
  - Card expands to fill viewport
  - Smooth scale and position transition
  - Loading shimmer effect

- **Portal Content**:
  - Full-screen artwork display with zoom capabilities
  - Collapsible information panels (left side)
  - Blockchain verification badge (top right)
  - Creator notes and story (bottom panel)
  - Purchase/action buttons (floating bottom right)

- **Exit Animation**:
  - Smooth zoom out to card grid
  - Background gradient restoration
  - Portal content fade-out

## Secondary Interactions

### Navigation System
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Page sections reveal with stagger animations
- **Filter Animations**: Artwork grid reorganization with fluid transitions
- **Search Interface**: Expanding search bar with live results
- **Menu Transitions**: Slide-in navigation with backdrop blur

### Data Visualization
- **Market Analytics**: Interactive charts with hover details
- **Price History**: Animated line graphs with data points
- **Collection Stats**: Counters with number animation
- **Blockchain Info**: Expandable technical details

### Community Features
- **Creator Profiles**: Hover cards with bio and portfolio preview
- **Collector Showcases**: Gallery walls of owned pieces
- **Social Interactions**: Like/save animations with heart effects
- **Comment System**: Floating comment bubbles with timestamps

## Interaction Patterns

### Responsive Behavior
- **Desktop**: Full hover effects and 3D transformations
- **Tablet**: Touch-friendly interactions with haptic feedback
- **Mobile**: Swipe gestures and simplified animations

### Accessibility
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full tab order with focus indicators
- **Screen Reader**: Proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- **Reduced Motion**: Respect user preferences for minimal animation
- **High Contrast**: Alternative color schemes for visibility

### Performance Optimization
- **Lazy Loading**: Images load as they enter viewport
- **Animation Throttling**: Reduce effects on lower-end devices
- **Memory Management**: Clean up WebGL contexts and event listeners
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript

## Micro-Interactions

### Feedback Systems
- **Loading States**: Elegant skeleton screens and progress indicators
- **Success States**: Checkmark animations and confirmation messages
- **Error States**: Gentle shake animations and helpful messaging
- **Empty States**: Illustrated placeholders with call-to-action

### Delightful Details
- **Cursor Effects**: Custom cursors that change based on context
- **Sound Design**: Subtle audio feedback for key interactions
- **Easter Eggs**: Hidden animations for power users
- **Celebration Moments**: Confetti effects for major actions
